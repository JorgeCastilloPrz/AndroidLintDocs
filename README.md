Lint source of knowledge. This is a try to gather all possible knowledge about Android Lint in a single place. It covers:

* Android Lint setup docs.
* Writing custom rules.
* Writing tests for custom rules.

## Setup Lint checks in separate module

* Create a Kotlin only library module (i.e: `lintchecks`).
* Add the following code to the module `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
jar {
    manifest {
        attributes("Lint-Registry-v2": "dev.jorgecastillo.lintchecks.CustomIssueRegistry")
    }
}

dependencies {
    // these two are used to write the custom rules and the registry.
    compileOnly("com.android.tools.lint:lint-api:$androidLintVersion")
    compileOnly("com.android.tools.lint:lint-checks:$androidLintVersion")

    // these are used to write the custom rule tests
    testImplementation "com.android.tools.lint:lint:$androidLintVersion"
    testImplementation "com.android.tools.lint:lint-tests:$androidLintVersion"
    testImplementation "com.android.tools:testutils:$androidLintVersion"
}
```

You can have `androidLintVersion` declared in main module like:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.androidLintVersion = '26.5.2'
}
```

Custom lint rules are registered through the `jar` task above that points to the custom lint rules registry using its fully qualified name: `dev.jorgecastillo.lintchecks.CustomIssueRegistry`.

That's an actual file we've got in the module, where all the custom rules are registered, like:

```kotlin
class CustomIssueRegistry : IssueRegistry() {

    override val api = CURRENT_API

    override val issues = listOf(
        EpoxyModelDetector.DATA_CLASS_ISSUE,
        NotThemedGetColorDetector.ISSUE,
        NotThemedColorStateListDetector.ISSUE,
        XMLDirectColorReferencesDetector.ISSUE,
        KotlinAndJavaDirectColorReferencesDetector.ISSUE,
        TextInputLayoutSetErrorDetector.ISSUE
    )
}
```

As you can see, custom lint rules are registered through their issues. In other words, you register a list of custom issues that are linked to their corresponding custom lint rules from inside.

This is an example of one of those issues that we always declare in the `companion object` of their corresponding detector class (custom rule).

```kotlin
companion object {

    val ISSUE = Issue.create(
        id = "KotlinAndJavaDirectColorReference",
        briefDescription = "Direct color reference in code",
        explanation = "This check forbids any usages of R.color in code (.kt and .java files) since those break " +
                "multiple theme compatibility. Please use R.attr to ensure the color is themed following the " +
                "context theme. Use `Context.getColorIntFromAttr(@AttrRes attr: Int): Int` for loading colors by " +
                "theme attribute.",
        category = Category.CORRECTNESS,
        priority = 8,
        severity = Severity.ERROR,
        implementation = Implementation(
            KotlinAndJavaDirectColorReferencesDetector::class.java,
            Scope.JAVA_FILE_SCOPE
        )
    )
}
```

The arguments are:
* `id`: That's the id for the check, the one you can use when ignoring occurrences in code (or XML).
* `briefDescription`: Self explanatory, you'll see this in the IDEA inspections popup.
* `explanation`: Same thing, more detailed description.
* `category`: This one states a category for the issue. Categories can be ignored all together.
* `priority`: You can set a priority value for the issue. Priority can be used to filter warnings or errors, ordering those etc.
* `severity`: This one decides whether it's gonna be considered a warning or a failure, among other choices.
* `implementation`: Here is where you link the required detector and decide what file scope you're interested in.

Finally, you just need to depend on this `lintchecks` kotlin module from the modules you want those checks to be installed and passed on, like the `app` one in the case of this sample.

```groovy
dependencies {
    lintChecks project(":lintchecks")
}
```

And that's pretty much it, you're good to go ðŸŽ‰

## How to write custom rules

For samples on how to write custom Lint rules, look at [the ones provided in this repo](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidLintDocs/tree/master/lintchecks/src/main/java/dev/jorgecastillo/lintchecks).

For more diverse samples you can also take a look at any classes extending `Detector`, there are tons of them that come built into Lint that you can take a look at in your IDE. Those should be available right away. You can also take a look at them [here](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/master/lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks).

## How to test custom rules

For samples on how to write tests, take a look at [the ones provided in this repo](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidLintDocs/tree/master/lintchecks/src/test/java/dev/jorgecastillo/lintchecks).

## Gotchas

If you are testing calls to a method **in a third party library** (i.e: `material`), tests are not able to resolve sources for those. You'll need to include a stub version of the required class (including a stub version of the called methods) in the test sources for the required scenarios, [the same way we did in this example](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidLintDocs/blob/master/lintchecks/src/test/java/dev/jorgecastillo/lintchecks/TextInputLayoutSetErrorDetectorTest.kt) for calling `TextInputLayout#setError()`.
